# Feature Planning

Create a new plan in `khaos-foundation/specs/*.md` to implement the `Feature` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan.

## Instructions

- You're writing a plan to implement a net new feature for the Khaos Machine platform.
- Create the plan in a `khaos-foundation/specs/*.md` file. Name it appropriately based on the `Feature`.
- Use the `Plan Format` below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase to understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions before planning the feature.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to implement the feature successfully.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the feature requirements, design, and implementation approach.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- Start your research by reading `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` for project context, then trace through relevant submodule code.
- This is a multi-repo workspace — the feature may span multiple submodules (KSPD, khaos-app, khaos-custody, khaos-foundation, khaos-manager, khaos-synth, khaos-tools, khaos-tui, khaosstorage, khaotik-ui).
- Design for extensibility and maintainability.

## Plan Format

```md
# Feature: <feature name>

## Feature Description
<describe the feature in detail, including its purpose and value>

## User Story
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this feature addresses>

## Solution Statement
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it solves the problem>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to implement the feature:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the feature describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to implement the feature, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe the foundational work needed before implementing the main feature>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work for the feature>

### Phase 3: Integration
<describe how the feature integrates with existing systems>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to implement the feature. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required then move on to the specific implementation. Include verification steps throughout. Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.>

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
<describe unit tests for the feature>

### Manual Verification
<describe manual verification steps for the feature>

### Edge Cases
<list edge cases that need to be tested>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the feature is implemented correctly with zero regressions.>

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes, future considerations, or context relevant to the feature>
```
