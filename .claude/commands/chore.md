# Chore Planning

Create a new plan in `khaos-foundation/specs/*.md` to resolve the `Chore` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan.

## Instructions

- You're writing a plan to resolve a chore, it should be simple but we need to be thorough and precise so we don't miss anything or waste time with any second round of changes.
- Create the plan in a `khaos-foundation/specs/*.md` file. Name it appropriately based on the `Chore`.
- Use the plan format below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase and put together a plan to accomplish the chore.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to accomplish the chore.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the plan and the steps to accomplish the chore.
- Start your research by reading `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` for project context, then trace through relevant submodule code.
- This is a multi-repo workspace — the chore may span multiple submodules (KSPD, khaos-app, khaos-custody, khaos-foundation, khaos-manager, khaos-synth, khaos-tools, khaos-tui, khaosstorage, khaotik-ui).

## Plan Format

```md
# Chore: <chore name>

## Chore Description
<describe the chore in detail>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the chore:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the chore describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to accomplish the chore, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to accomplish the chore. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required then move on to specific changes. Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the chore is complete with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors.>

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes or context relevant to the chore>
```
