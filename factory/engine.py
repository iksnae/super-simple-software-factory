"""The workflow interpreter: a declared phase graph, executed.

Each stock workflow used to be one Python file whose docstring WAS its chain —
the single best teaching artifact in the original repo. Moving the graph into
config buys reuse (a repo picks and tunes a workflow instead of forking a
script) and costs that legibility, so it is paid back deliberately:
`describe_chain` renders the resolved graph from config, and the run prints it
and writes it into the trace before the first phase opens. The chain is still
readable; it is derived now instead of hand-written, and therefore cannot drift
from what actually runs.

Eight step kinds cover every stock workflow:

    request       record the incoming ask (the engineer's own phase)
    agent         one agent call: typed envelope out, gates verified
    quality       run named deterministic checks
    verify_loop   quality, then an agent repair, bounded — "does it run"
    review_loop   an agent verdict, then an agent revision, bounded — "is it what was asked"
    changes       diff the run against its pinned baseline, for a documenter
    commit        commit the tree in one agent's own words
    group         a nested list of steps, usually behind a `when:` condition

Ahead of all of them, when the repo's config declares `prepare:`, comes one phase
that no workflow asks for: the commands that make the tree runnable at all. It is
not a step kind because it is not a choice — a tree with no dependencies installed
cannot be planned against, built in, or tested, whichever workflow you picked.

Nothing here decides anything a phase could decide for itself. The engine's only
judgements are the ones the ADW scripts made in Python: what counts as verified,
when a stale green result must be re-earned, and what stops the chain.
