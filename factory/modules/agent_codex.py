"""Codex CLI as a coding agent — the slot `agent_cc.py` stubbed and never filled.

Same module interface as `agent_pi`, so `agents.execute` dispatches on
`coding_agent` and nothing else in the engine changes: `resolve_model`,
`assistant_message_records`, `ToolCallTracker`, `run`.

## Why this exists beside pi rather than replacing it

Two billing models, and the split is the point. Codex authenticates against a
ChatGPT subscription and serves closed models (gpt-6-astra, gpt-5.6-sol/terra/
luna/pro); OpenRouter is used exclusively for open-weight models through pi. A
roster can therefore put judgement on a subscription model and code generation on
an open-weight one, and pay for each the way it is actually sold.

## What Codex gives that pi does not

  --sandbox        a real enforcement boundary (read-only / workspace-write),
                   so `writes: []` becomes something the OS refuses rather than
                   something we detect afterwards. Permission checking still runs
                   — belt and braces — but the belt is now real.
  exec resume      resumes a thread by id, which is exactly what a gate
                   correction needs: same context, bounded retries.

## Four things measured on live runs, each of which would otherwise bite

1. `item.type == "error"` is INFORMATIONAL. A first probe returned four of them
   — hook-trust notices, a skill-budget warning — on a turn that succeeded and
   returned the right answer. Treating them as failures would fail every run.

2. `--ignore-user-config` removes all of that noise, and is correct for a
   factory regardless: the operator's `config.toml` carries MCP servers (which
   emitted OAuth transport errors on the probe), notify hooks, and a default
   model. A phase must depend on none of them. Auth still resolves, because auth
   lives in CODEX_HOME rather than in config.toml.

3. The `codex` on PATH may not be Codex. On this machine it is a cmux shim that
   injects `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`; the probe's stray error items came
   from exactly that. `_binary()` therefore skips shim directories.

4. `usage` carries NO cost. Subscription billing is not metered per token, so
   cost is reported as 0.0 and the token counts are real. A codex lane showing
   $0.0000 beside real tokens in the trace is correct, not a bug — and it is why
   `just obs costs` cannot be read as total spend for a mixed roster.
