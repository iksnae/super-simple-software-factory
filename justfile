# software-factory — one factory, many repos.
#
# Every recipe takes the target repo as its first argument, defaulting to the cwd.
# That default is what makes the shared checkout comfortable: `cd` into a project,
# run `just -f ~/Developer/software-factory/justfile sdlc "..."`, or add the shell
# alias from `just install-alias` and just type `sf`.
#
# THREE NAMESPACES, and the namespace answers WHAT you are doing:
#   (root)   run work:        sdlc / simple-sdlc / scout / plan / build / quality / ...
#   config   inspect config:  list / explain / check / doctor / init / rosters
#   obs      read the trace:  sessions / phases / events / tail / gates / costs / ui

set positional-arguments
set dotenv-load

# A module inherits NOTHING — not variables, not settings, not the working
# directory — so each one re-declares what it needs. Every missing line fails in
# a different silent way, which is why they are repeated rather than centralised.
#
# The comment directly above a `mod` becomes its help text, so each gets its own.

# inspect and validate configuration
mod config 'just/config.just'

# read the trace of past and running work
mod obs 'just/obs.just'

SF := justfile_directory() / "scripts/sf.py"

# just runs recipes with cwd set to the JUSTFILE directory, not the one you
# typed in. Left alone, `--repo .` would mean the factory itself. Every run
# recipe therefore passes the invocation directory explicitly, BEFORE "$@",
# so an explicit --repo later on the line still wins.
HERE := invocation_directory()

# Each recipe is one `sf run <workflow>`. The extra ARGS pass straight through,
